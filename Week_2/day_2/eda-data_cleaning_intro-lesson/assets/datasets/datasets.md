Datasets should be stored in this folder, as needed. 

Dataset files should be stored locally, when possible. When possible, please provide a data dictionary or readme - especially if there are multiple files.

If you are linking to external datasets, revise this readme accordingly with links and any accompanying instructions.


The relative link to this folder from the lesson/lab would be:
