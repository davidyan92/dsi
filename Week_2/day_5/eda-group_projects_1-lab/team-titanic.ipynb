    "The Titanic dataset is a common dataset for doing classification prediction of fatalities.  For our challenge, why don't we try to focus on the latent characteristics in the data. Your goal is to explore the relationships between variables in the dataset. Which variables seem to be related, which are unrelated? Are there surprises when you look at different cross-sections of the data? \n",
