    "## `pandas` Long Format, Wide Format, Pivot Tables, and Melting\n",

    "This lesson is all about transforming data using `pandas`. Data transformation is the reorganization of your data set's rows and columns into a different, potentially more useful shape and format. \n",
    "\n",
    "The benefits of transforming your data include better access to relevant information and streamlined data manipulation. As you become more familiar with data sets and their associated operations, you will develop an intuition and appreciation for when it's better to work row-wise or column-wise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Different data formats are better for different tasks. It takes time and experience to learn the distinctions. But, for now, we'll introduce the common structures, transformations, and how to apply these transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Objectives\n",
    "- Understand the differences between long and wide format data.\n",
    "- Understand pivot tables.\n",
    "- Practice transforming data between long and wide formats.\n",
    "- Practice creating pivot tables.\n",
    "- Learn how to avoid common pitfalls and obstacles in data transformation with `pandas`.\n"

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Between \"wide\" and \"long,\" wide format data is the more intuitive. It's also a common format for `.csv` files. You've already viewed multiple data sets in wide format throughout this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wide format data is structured so that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Unique IDs, subjects, observations, etc. are represented as rows.\n",
    "- Distinct information categories (variables) are represented as columns. In other words, there is a column for every \"variable\" with its own unique values.\n",
    "- This format can often be a more compact matrix, particularly if little or no information is missing.\n",
    "- It is not as useful for SQL-style operations: It can make it much harder or even impossible to join tables together on a value.\n",
    "- It can be useful in `pandas` when you need to perform operations on variables **across columns**; for example, multiplying columns together to create a new column.\n",
    "- It is the data format required for statistical modeling (with few exceptions)."

    "- **`index`**: Columns in the long format data that are index variables. These will be left as single columns, not spread out by unique value like in the `columns` parameter.\n",
    "- **`aggfunc`**: Often `.pivot_table()` is used to perform a summary of the data. `aggfunc` stands for \"aggregation function.\" It's required and defaults to `np.mean()`. You can also insert your own function, which we'll demonstrate below.\n",

My data is messy, so I have to write a function to check for places it could break. \n",
