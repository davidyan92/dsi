    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Models often have specifications that can be set. For example, when we choose a linear regression, we may decide to add a penalty to the loss function such as the Ridge or the Lasso. Those penalties require the regularization strength, alpha, to be set. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Model parameters are called hyperparameters.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Hyperparameters are different than the parameters of the model resulting from a fit, such as the coefficients. The hyperparameters are set prior to the fit and determine the behavior of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are often more than one kind of hyperparamter to set for a model. For example, in the KNN algorithm, we have a hyperparameter to set the number of neighbors. We also have a hyperparameter for the weights: uniform or distance? We want to know the *optimal* hyperparameter settings, the set that results in the best model evaluation. \n",
    "\n",
    "**The search for the optimal set of hyperparameters is called gridsearching.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Gridsearching gets its name from the fact that we are searching over a \"grid\" of parameters. For example, imagine the `n_neighbors` hyperparameters on the x-axis and `weights` on the y-axis, and we need to test all points on the grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Gridsearching uses cross-validation internally to evaluate the performance of each set of hyperparameters.** More on this later."
