    "# Fast Food Chains and Price Discrimination\n",

    "This group lab uses a 1994 dataset that has detailed prices on items sold at over 400 Burger King, Wendy's, KFC and [Roy Roger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Rogers_Restaurants) restaurants in New Jersey and Pennsivania.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a restricted version of the dataset used in this publication:\n",

    "\n",
    "**The goal of this this exercise is to evaluate whether fast-food restaurants are using discriminatory pricing.** This is a fairly open ended prompt and it up to you how you want to quantify pricing discrimination. There are two immediate groups of variables that can help you investigate this:\n",
    "- You have the prices of items, which can be a metric of discriminatory practices (charging higher prices).\n",
    "- You have proportion of African Americans, proportion of low income, and proportion of residents without a car.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### In groups, you should:\n",
    "1. **Load the data and examine it.**\n",
    "2. **Perform any required data cleaning.**\n",
    "3. **Conduct EDA relevant to the goals of the project.** What variables are you interested in for your target(s) and predictors? What kinds of relationships to you see in the data that will inform your analysis?\n",
    "4. **Formulate your hypotheses and formally define them.** Come up with a plan, based on the prompt and your EDA, for testing your hypotheses.\n",
    "5. **Construct regression models to test your hypotheses.** What do you find? Do you accept or reject your hypothesis? What are the limitations and assumptions of your approach? \n",
    "6. **[Bonus] Cross-validate the results of your regression.** If you achieved positive results, do these hold up during cross-validation or train/test split?\n",
    "7. **Prepare a brief (10 minute) presentation on the findings.** Your group will present on the questions you asked, models you built, and findings.\n",
    "    - Be concise! Only present information that is relevant.\n",
    "    - Visuals are nice but don't overdo it.\n",
    "    - Don't just talk about the significance or metrics in your model. Interpret the coefficients. What are the implications?\n",
    "    - What future directions would you go in from here?\n",
