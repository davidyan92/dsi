    "It is important to be cautious with categorical variables, those that represent distict groups or categories, when building a regression. If put in a regression \"as-is\", categorical variables represented as integers will be treated like *continuous* variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is to say, instead of group \"3\" having a different effect on the estimation than group \"1\" it will estimate literally 3 times more than group 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if occupation category \"1\" represents \"analyst\" and occupation category \"3\" represents \"barista\", and our target variable is salary, if we leave this as a column of integers then barista will always have `beta*3` the effect of analyst.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will almost certainly force the beta coefficient to be something strange and incorrect. Instead, we can re-represent the categories as multiple \"dummy coded\" columns.\n",

Rather than saying \"a one unit change in X,\" the coefficient associated with \"sex = F\" is interpreted as the average change in Y when sex = F relative to when sex = M.\n",
