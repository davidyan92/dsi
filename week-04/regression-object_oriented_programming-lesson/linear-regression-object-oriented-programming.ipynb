    "### The \"least squares\" solution to linear regression\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1:** With target vector $y$ and prediction matrix $X$, we can formulate a regression as:\n",
    "\n",
    "### $$ y = \\beta X + \\epsilon $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $\\beta$ is our vector of coefficients and $\\epsilon$ is our vector of errors, or residuals.\n",

    "**Step 2:** We can equivalently formulate this as a calculation of the residuals:\n",
    "\n",
    "### $$ \\epsilon = \\beta X - y $$\n",
    "\n",
    "*Our goal is to minimize the sum of squared residuals.* This is also known as the \"least squares loss function\". \n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3:** Solve for the sum of squared residuals on the left side of the equation. Recall the vector of errors are equivalent to the residuals. The sum of squared residuals is represented as the dot product of the vector of residuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "### $$ \\sum_{i=1}^n \\epsilon_i^2 = \n",
    "\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}\n",
    "\\epsilon_1 \\cdots \\epsilon_n\n",
    "\\end{array}\\right] \n",
    "\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}\n",
    "\\epsilon_1 \\\\ \\cdots \\\\ \\epsilon_n\n",
    "\\end{array}\\right] = \\epsilon' \\epsilon\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore we can write the sum of squared residuals as:\n",
    "\n",
    "### $$ \\epsilon' \\epsilon = (\\beta X - y)' (\\beta X - y) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Which becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "### $$ \\epsilon' \\epsilon = y'y - y'X\\beta - \\beta' X' y + \\beta' X' X \\beta $$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4:** We want to find the coefficients where the loss function will be minimum. In this case we can use calculus, taking the derivative with respect to the $\\beta$ vector:\n",
    "\n",
    "### $$ \\frac{\\partial \\epsilon' \\epsilon}{\\partial \\beta} = \n",
    "-2X'y + 2X'X\\beta$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since want to minimize loss function and the loss function is convex, we set the derivative to zero and solve for the beta coefficient vector:\n",
    "\n",
    "### $$ 0 = -2X'y + 2X'X\\beta \\\\\n",
    "X'X\\beta = X'y \\\\\n",
