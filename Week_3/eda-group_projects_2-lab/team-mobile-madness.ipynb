    "You are on the data science department of a mobile device company. In an effort to extend account lifetime of existing customers, we need to develop targeted A/B experiments. In order to do that efficiently, we need to have a better degree of certainty about which customers are likely to to \"churn\" and why.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goals:**\n",
    "- Research the concept of \"churn\" and A/B testing.\n",
    "- Identify behaviors strongly correlated with churn in this dataset.\n",
    "- Suggest what we should develop A/B tests for going forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Presentation requirements:**\n",
    "- Concisely explain churn and A/B testing to the audience.\n",
    "- At least 50% of presentation must address a non-technical audience.\n",
    "- Someone who hasn't presented in class yet must take lead on presentation."
