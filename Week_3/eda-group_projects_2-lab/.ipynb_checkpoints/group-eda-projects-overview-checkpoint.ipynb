    "These group EDA projects are focused on presenting findings at a high level to a non-technical audience. The timeframe to perform the EDA and develop the presentations are limited, so time-boxing your work is critical. Make sure that you give yourself enough time to develop a compelling presentation to give to your classmates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please focus on the provided goals. How achievable are they? Give numeric evidence for your findings and arguments. Not everything is achievable, so it's important to explain *why* to an audience that doesn't know anything about data analysis.  Specifically, in the event that a goal can't be achieved, explain why in simple language and back this reasoning up with measurable details.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's also important to address your approach to the problem to the class audience. A notebook presentation is fine for a technical report, but because your priority is convincing a non-technical audience you should strongly consider making a more formal and polished slideshow.  Keep in mind that while explaining your code can still be relevant, **frame everything you present in terms of the audience and the goals**.  If what you're choosing to present isn't relevant or necessary please consider ommitting those details.\n"
