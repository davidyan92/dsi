    "Say we wanted to calculate the 95% confidence interval around a statistic such as our sample mean. We could do this using the formula derived based on the Central Limit Theorm (CLT), selecting z-scores along the unit Normal distribution that corresponds to our confidence level and multiplying them by our standard error.\n",
