    "Spark relaxes the constraints of Map-Reduce by doing the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- generalizes computation from Map/Reduce only graphs to arbitrary Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)\n",
    "- removes a lot of boilerplate code present in Hadoop\n",

    "- **Spark SQL**: Provides APIs for interacting with Spark via the Apache Hive variant of SQL called Hive Query Language (HiveQL). Every database table is represented as an RDD and Spark SQL queries are transformed into Spark operations. For those that are familiar with Hive and HiveQL, Spark can act as a drop-in replacement.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Spark Streaming**: Enables the processing and manipulation of live streams of data in real time. Many streaming data libraries (such as Apache Storm) exist for handling real-time data. Spark Streaming enables programs to leverage this data similar to how you would interact with a normal RDD as data is flowing in.\n",
