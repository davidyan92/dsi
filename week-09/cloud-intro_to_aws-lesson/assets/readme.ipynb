    "_Amazon Web Services (AWS)_, is a subsidiary of Amazon.com, which offers a suite of cloud computing services that make up an on-demand computing platform. These services operate from 12 geographical regions across the world. The most central and best-known of these services arguably include Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud, also known as \"EC2\", and Amazon Simple Storage Service, also known as \"S3\". AWS now has more than 70 services that span a wide range including compute, storage, networking, database, analytics, application services, deployment, management, mobile, developer tools and tools for the Internet of things. Amazon markets AWS as a service to provide large computing capacity quicker and cheaper than a client company building an actual physical server farm. _(from wikipedia)_\n",

    "\n",
    "The first service we will discover is _Elastic Compute Cloud_ or _EC2_. This service forms a central part of Amazon.com's cloud-computing platform by allowing users to rent virtual computers on which to run their own computer applications. Let's learn some terms first:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Instance**: virtual machine hosted in Amazon Cloud running the software we want\n",
    "- **Amazon Machine Image (AMI)**: a snapshot of a configured machine that we can use as starting point to boot an instance. We can also save a running instance to a new AMI so that in the future we can boot a new machine with identical configuration.\n",
    "- **SSH Key**: [pair of keys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography) necessary to connect to an instance remotely. The private key will be downloaded to our laptop, the matching public key will be automatically configured on the instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The main conceptual shift from using a laptop to running an instance in the cloud is that we should think of computing power as ephemeral. We can request computing power when we need it, do a calculation and dismiss that power as we are done. Input and output will not be stored on the machine, rather stored somewhere else in the cloud (hint: S3). In this sense, computing power is a commodity that we purchase and use in the amount and time that we need.\n",

    "\n",
    "1) Create a new account on AWS [here](https://aws.amazon.com/)\n",

    "\n",
    "1. (optional) download a bash shell\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Step 4: Terminate Your Instance\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you're done with your calculation and you no longer need the instance, you can go ahead and terminate it. NB: this will kill the instance and it will no longer be available to you. You should make sure you have saved all the data and the code you needed somewhere else.\n",

    "### Additional remarks\n",
    "\n",
    "We've seen the simplest way to launch and terminate an instance in the cloud.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's a lot more to it, that you'll discover in time, here are some pointers you may find useful:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/): EC2 pricing depends on the type of instance and on the chosen region. Make sure you understand the cost of the instance you request in order to avoid surprise bills. If you're in doubt you can use the convenient [Cost Calculator](http://calculator.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) to get an exact forecast of your costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./assets/images/costcalculator.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Spot instances](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-spot-instances.html): spot instances are even more ephemeral than normal instances. They only live till their cost is lower than the price you agreed to pay. They are a great way to save money when using more powerful machines.\n",
    "- [AMIs](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AMIs.html) AMIs are shapshot of our machine. They are great if we installed a lot of software on our machine and want to save that particular configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./assets/images/createimage.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Check:** can you give an example of when AMIs could be useful?\n",
    "> Answer: e.g. if we have downloaded and installed Anaconda Python\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Security Groups](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-network-security.html): security groups are ways to open ports to the services running on our machine.\n",
    "**Check:** can you give an example of a practical case?\n",
    "> Answer: e.g. if we are running IPython notebook on the instance and want to reach it from a browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Elastic IPs](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/elastic-ip-addresses-eip.html): we can rent a fixed IP address and associate it to our instance. This way we can configure tools to always connect to the same address, independently of which machine is behind it.\n",
