    "- Install local virtual machine running apache Hadoop\n",
    "- Navigate Hadoop file system (HDFS)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Preparation\n",
    "*Before this lesson, you will need to:*\n",
    "- Go through the installation of the virtual machine\n",
    "- Have the students download the virtual machine image on their own before the lab; see instructions below.\n",
    "- Note: Data assets for this lesson are included in the virtual machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Instructors: This week requires some additional preparation. *First*, you'll need to assist students with the use of the Virtual Machine to run the first few lessons and labs. *Second*, you'll need to check with your local team about buying or accessing AWS credits for your students to use EC2 and EMR services.\n"
