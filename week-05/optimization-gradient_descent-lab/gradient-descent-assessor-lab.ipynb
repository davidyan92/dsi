    "Until now we've been using specific sklearn model classes to perform regression and classification such as `LinearRegression` and `LogisticRegression`. Unfortunately, while these methods work well on smaller datasets with relatively small numbers of columns, once you start getting into \"Medium Data\" these slow down to a crawl, and take up so much memory that fitting them becomes mind-numbingly slow (especially on a laptop).\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily, sklearn comes with  stochastic gradient descent solvers for regression and classification:\n",
    "- `SGDRegressor`\n",
    "- `SGDClassifier`\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to its ability to minimize the loss function iteratively on smaller portions of the data, it avoids the intense slowdown other models suffer on large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** The gradient descent solvers are very flexible and can fit a variety of different model types not covered here. I highly recommend reading their documentation in detail.\n",
