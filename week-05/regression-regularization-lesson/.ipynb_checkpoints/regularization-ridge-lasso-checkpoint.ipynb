    "**To demonstrate the effects we will be using a dataset on wine quality.**\n",
    "\n",
    "An important aspect of this data, which is a reason why we might choose to use regularization, is that there is **multicollinearity** in the data. The term multicollinearity means that there are high correlations between predictor variables in your model. \n",
    "\n",
    "**This can lead to a variety of problems including:**\n",
    "1. The effect of predictor variables estimated by your regression will depend on what other variabes are included in your model.\n",
    "2. Predictors can have wildly different effects depending on the observations in your sample, and small changes in samples can result in very different estimated effects.\n",
    "3. With very high multicollinearity, the inverse matrix the computer calculates may not be accurate.\n",
    "4. We can no longer interpret a coefficient on a variable as the effect on the target of a one unit increase in that variable holding the other variables constant. This is because when predictors are strongly correlated, there is not a scenario in which one variable can change without a conditional change in another variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Ridge is best suited to deal with multicollinearity. Lasso also deals with multicollinearity between variables, but in a more brutal way (it \"zeroes out\" the less effective variable).\n",
    "\n",
    "The Lasso is particularly useful when you have redundant or unimportant variables. If you have 1000 variables in a dataset the Lasso can perform \"feature selection\" automatically for you by forcing coefficients to be zero."
